# DoubleBlind
For assisting with performing social double blind experiments

## Introduction
This application is intended to be used to facilitate a type of social experiment I like to host occasionally. I use it to gather opinions on a set something (usually a beverage, like beer or wine). These experiments are double blind, by which I mean that niether the host nor the participants know the identity of the subject there are giving an opinion on. 

## What it does
- Facilitates and records the twice anonymizing process so that it can be easily and correctly reversed after the trial.
- Helps specify what is asked of the participant.
- Prevents participants from reviewing subjects multiple times (if desired).
- Makes it easier for participants to privately review subjects.
- Exports the data in an easy to analyze format.

## How it works
1. The host uses the management software to create the study, specify the subjects and the questions, and set options.
2. The subjects are twice anonymized. Assuming the subjects are in indistinguishable vessels, one or two people give each subject an alias and record it in the software. This happens out of view of anyone else. Then a different person or persons scrambles or re-alias the subjects and records this. Now there is nobody who knows the true identity of any of the subjects.
3. Begin the trial. Participants may use their smartphone to privately submit reviews.
4. Conclude the trial. The results may be exported in '.csv' format.
